                                   <br/><br/>Let's start with the basics. The time zone that covers the majority of California is Pacific Standard Time (PST), which is eight hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-8). This time zone covers cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. However, a small portion of California near the Nevada border observes Mountain Standard Time (MST), which is seven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7). This includes cities like Lake Tahoe and Mammoth Lakes.

                                   <br/><br/> During the summer months, California observes Daylight Saving Time (DST), which means that clocks are turned forward by one hour. This change usually happens on the second Sunday of March and lasts until the first Sunday of November. When DST is in effect, Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) is used instead of PST, which is seven hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC-7).

                                   <br/><br/>It's important to note that not all states in the United States observe Daylight Saving Time. Hawaii, for example, does not observe DST at all. Additionally, the Navajo Nation in Arizona does not observe DST, but the rest of Arizona does.

                                   <br/><br/> If you're planning a trip to California, it's important to keep these time zone and DST changes in mind. This can impact flight schedules, hotel reservations, and even dinner reservations. However, most devices such as smartphones, computers, and smartwatches should automatically update to the correct time zone when you arrive in California.
